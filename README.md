I learned things which is I never know in the past.

mkdir #create directory or folder
touch #create a text file

git clone git@github...... #cloning repos of github to local folder
git status #text red color(not yet staged)
git add (filename.txt) #waiting room to commit
git status #text green color (in staging area)
git commit -m "Add (filename)"
git status #changes has been committed
git log #viewing all the changes committed
